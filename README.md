# Melodic_Transformations
Author: Daniel Pitherin

Version: 1.0

Last Updated: 10/29/2017

Functionality: This program takes a sequence of note names from the user, converts the sequence to pitches, generates
               new pitch sequences based off three types of melodic transformations (inversion, retrograde, and
               inverse retrograde) based on the user's selection, then translates each pitch sequence to a sequence of
               note names and outputs that final sequence

Sample input: C# D Eb

Planned Updates:  
- Implementing audio playback
- Tweaking note-name conversion function to handle less-scalar pitch sequences correctly
